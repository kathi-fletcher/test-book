Momentum is 
        a property which applies to moving objects, in fact it is mass in motion. If something 
        has mass and it is moving then it has momentum.&nbsp;</p><div class="body" id="44b414a0-a32f-d4cc-a2cc-9391516d5dda" data-unknown="true">

</math><p>Momentum is directly proportional to both the mass and velocity of an object. A small car 
        travelling at the same velocity as a big truck will have a smaller momentum than 
        the truck. The smaller the mass, the smaller the momentum for a fixed velocity. If 
        the mass is constant then the greater the velocity the greater the momentum. The momentum 
        will always be in the same direction as the velocity because mass is a scalar not a 
        vector.</p><p style=""><br></p></body>
