    Master before Tom's file name changes.</h1><p>Adding books and files adds the right things and auto-saves the new files. The save button lit up, but had nothing to show. Clicking it never returned. Trying to open any file failed after that. Reloading restored everything. The "I look dirty when I am not" file never got starred.</p><h1 style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Master + 56661206 (make file names better)</h1><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Opened test book and "Math breaks things". When I cicked on "I look dirty", "Math breaks things" got starred.</p></body>
